# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
## Description
This project aims to predict breast cancer using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various features extracted from breast cancer images to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 569 instances and 30 features.

## Dependencies
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Execute each cell to train the model and make predictions.
4. Analyze the results and metrics displayed in the notebook.

## Results
The breast cancer prediction model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset, with a precision of 96%, recall of 94%, and F1-score of 95%.
